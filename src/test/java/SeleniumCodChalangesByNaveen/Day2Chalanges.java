    Day #2 - Selenium Coding Challenge (Carousel Handling)- By Naveen AutomationLabs
========================
Open Chrome/Firefox
Launch app : https://www.noon.com/uae-en/â€‹

Get the carousel items from:
 Recommended For You
 Sports shoes under 199 AED
 Top picks in laptops
 Limited time offers
 Bestselling fragrances

You need to create a generic function, this will take the sectionName(String) as an input parameter and will return the collection of all the carousel items text in sorted order only.

You need to keep clicking on the next arrow icon until its disappeared and keep fetching the text of each item in carousel.

Prepare a 3-5 mins of video of your solution and explain your code and show the demo.
Please push your source code to GIT Repo and share with me at:
